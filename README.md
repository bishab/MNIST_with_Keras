# MNIST_USING_KERAS


Hello! Ever since Neural Network has been open sourced, things have changed far more than before. Now they launched [GPT-3](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/) with almost 175 billion features and things are accelerating!

But, for a beginner, things will always start from the very beginning and accelerate thereafter.  We will not delay, nor accelerate, but will begin from the scratch. 

**Here I will demonstrate the very basics of Keras (as they call it the hello world of neural network) implementation in our very popular mnist dataset.**
